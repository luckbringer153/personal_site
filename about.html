        <h2><i>Hello!</i></h2>
        <p>
          <b>I received my</b> Bachelor of Science from Oregon State University
          with a major in industrial engineering and a minor in food technology.
          My original goal was to pursue a plant manager role at any large-size
          food production company. In service to this, I completed two
          engineering internships with Glanbia Nutritionals and one with E. & J.
          Gallo Winery. I learned that I'm very good at adapting to new
          development processes quickly when a better way of doing things
          presents itself. I strive to prioritize the customer (internal or
          external) in any of my projects, especially in the areas of
          communication, usability, and longevity. Lastly, I learned that I love
          diving deep into the troubleshooting stages of a project - it's like a
          big puzzle! Fortunately I had the opportunity to create multiple
          macro-enabled Excel workbooks with Visual Basic for Applications
          (VBA), and it was there I discovered that my true passion lied in
          coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>In pursuit of</b> a technical role, I transitioned to my current
          position as a Business Analyst II with Insight Global. Working
          remotely, I've honed my communication and project organization skills
          through projects with Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) and Chevron.
          I've audited over 60,000 wildfire ignition reports, prototyped
          improved processes for incoming data processing, and balanced
          throughness with efficiency for our high-priority projects. In the
          past year, I've grown my coding "toolbelt" by learning and practicing
          new coding languages, the first of these being Transcript-SQL via a
          two-month SQL certificate course offered by the Learning Resources
          Network (LERN). The second was the completion of a web development
          certificate offered by Fullstack Academy through San Jose State
          University. This 12-week course taught me full-stack development
          fundamentals, including front-end (HTML, CSS) and back-end (JS, React,
          NodeJS, PostgreSQL) development. This course culminated in a capstone
          project wherein me and two students developed a fully-functional
          e-commerce website in less than two weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Currently, I am</b> a full-stack engineer seeking an entry-level
          role in web or database design. My background may be "unconventional"
          in software engineering, but it has given me accelerated exposure to
          customer satisfaction, the design-to-prototype-to-deployment life
          cycle, and to engaging the strengths of the whole team. I thrive in
          the development process!
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Outside of work,</b> I love to cook, bake, and grow hot peppers.
          Most evenings you'll find me line dancing or tinkering with personal
          projects. I primarly code in Visual Studio Code, using the Ubuntu
          terminal to connect with GitHub repositories. View my GitHub or the
          "My Portfolio" section for information about my previous and current
          projects.
